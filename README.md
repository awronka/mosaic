# Mosaic
Quick pass at a google chrome extension to help collaboration and workflows for front-enders and designers.

Mosaic applies an outline CSS style to all elements on the page to let you can see their formating and arrangement. In addition, when you hover over an element, it shows its type, ID, and classes. To further help with understanding how its CSS may be inheriting, it also reveals that elemet's parent elements.

Recently added were flags for javascript events and global commenting system so anyone, from employees to strangers, can leave design feedback on your website!
